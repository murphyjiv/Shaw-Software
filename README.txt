Site created: December 12, 2019
Original Authors: Luke Sterrett and James Murphy

Notes for future editors:
	-This site utilizes Bootstrap 4, Parallax effects, jQuery, JS, HTML, and CSS

	-The css/global-stylesheet.css contains multiple sections which are labeled. At the bottom of the file you will find the style for the nav bar, quote carousel, footer, and themed buttons.

	-If you would like to make another blog post, the template for it is located at the bottom of index.html's page specific content section. 

	-Because this site was not developed using a build tool, each page has a separate copy of the nav bar, quote carousel, and footer in it. Unfortunately, that means if you would like to change something you have to update all of their pages.
		**WARNING: Links are specific based on the folder the html file is located. Meaning, you can't copy and paste the html/contacts.html header into the css/services/servicenow.html because it is a level below.
